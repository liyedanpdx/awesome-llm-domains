# Awesome LLM Domains

A curated collection of resources on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application domains, featuring easy-to-digest introductions to foundational concepts and state-of-the-art developments. This repository is continuously updated with key knowledge and insights Iâ€™ve gained through learning and research.
