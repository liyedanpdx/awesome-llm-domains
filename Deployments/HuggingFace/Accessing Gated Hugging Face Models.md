# Accessing Gated Hugging Face Models

## Common Authorization Issues

When you encounter a `GatedRepoError` while trying to access restricted models like Mistral-7B-v0.1, follow these steps to resolve access issues:

### 1. Request Access on the Web Interface

- Visit the model page (e.g., https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1)
- Click "Access repository" or "Request access" button
- Complete any required forms explaining your use case
- **Important**: Make sure to accept all license agreements and terms

### 2. Ensure Proper CLI Authentication

Log out and log in again with the Hugging Face CLI:

```bash
huggingface-cli logout
huggingface-cli login

```

When prompted, enter a new access token from the Hugging Face website:

- Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- Create a new token with all necessary permissions
- Copy and paste the token when prompted during login

### 3. Clear Cache (If Needed)

If authentication issues persist, try clearing your Hugging Face cache:

```bash
# Install required dependencies first
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]

# OR use the disable-tui flag
huggingface-cli delete-cache --disable-tui

```

In the interactive cache manager:

- Press <space> to select cache entries to delete
- Press <enter> to confirm your selection
- Select "None of the following" if you don't want to delete anything

### 4. Set Up Network Proxy (If Applicable)

If you're behind a firewall, configure proxies:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://your_proxy:port
export HTTP_PROXY=http://your_proxy:port

```

### 5. Check for Service Issues

Visit Hugging Face status page to verify there are no ongoing service disruptions.

### 6. Consider Alternative Models

If you continue experiencing access issues, consider using alternative open-access models:

- Llama-2 series
- Gemma series
- Phi-2
- Other open 7B models with similar capabilities

## Common Authorization Problems

- **Delayed Authorization**: Changes to access permissions can take time to propagate
- **License Agreement Issues**: Some models require explicit acceptance of multiple agreements
- **Token Permission Problems**: Your token may not have sufficient permissions
- **Account Verification**: Some models require verified accounts
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Certain models may have regional access limitations
